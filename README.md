# ElectricityBillingSystem
The Electricity Billing System is designed to help manage electricity billing for consumers. This Java-based desktop application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where the administrator can log in, add customer data, calculate electricity bills, and save and retrieve information. The system is primarily built with “Java Swing” for the user interface and utilizes file handling to store data.
The project provides an easy way for administrators to manage customer information, track electricity consumption, and generate bills accordingly. It also ensures that users can securely log in and view detailed billing information for each customer.
